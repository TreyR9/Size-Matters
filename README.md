# Size Matters
 A player height mod for Monster Hunter: World utilizing Fexty's [Sharp Plugin Loader](https://fexty12573.github.io/SharpPluginLoader/). 
## Installation:
 1. Ensure you have [Stracker's Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/1982) and [Sharp Plugin Loader](https://fexty12573.github.io/SharpPluginLoader/Installation/), download the .zip files and extract them to your root Monster Hunter: World directory. (The directory can be easily accessed by right clicking the game in Steam, hovering over Manage, and selecting Browse Local Files).
 2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/TreyR9/Size-Matters/releases), and extract the contents of the .zip folder to your root Monster Hunter: World directory.
## Usage:
 The plugin is automatically loaded whenever the game boots. To adjust the size of a character, open the Configuration.txt file found in Monster Hunter World\nativePC\plugins\CSharp\Size Matters and change the numerical values shown.
 This can be done on a per-save-slot basis, and accepts a numerical value (default is 1.0). Inputting negative or high numbers is not recommended.
 You will be able to preview these changes once you load a save.
